# Hello!
Originally, this repo was meant to serve as a JS Bookmarklet repo. But I did not like transitioning my code to be bookmarklet-friendly, so I have saved it so you can just copy and paste the code into your console. 
## Warning!!!
Ok, specifically my code is safe <sub> (Please feel free to search it yourself) </sub> but not all Javascript code you find online is safe, so before running any code any one sends you <sub>even trusted people</sub> be sure to check that there is nothing bad in the code such as a cookie stealer. Just some informational stuff. lol
### Enjoy my code, as its cool like that.
